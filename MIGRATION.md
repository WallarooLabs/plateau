# Migration Plan: arrow2 to arrow-rs

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Plateau repository from arrow2 to arrow-rs. The migration will be performed gradually, crate by crate, to ensure a smooth transition and easier code review.

## Migration Strategy

For each crate, we will:

1. Create a copy of the crate with `-arrow-rs` suffix (e.g., `transport` â†’ `transport-arrow-rs`).
2. Make an immediate commit of the copied crate to establish a clean base for comparison.
3. Update the new crate to use arrow-rs instead of arrow2.
4. Ensure all tests pass and there are no warnings (`cargo test` and `cargo check`).
5. Move on to the next crate in the dependency order.

## Dependency Order Analysis

Based on the repository structure, the migration order is determined by dependencies between crates:

- **transport**: Base library with direct arrow2 dependencies, no internal dependencies.
- **client**: Depends on transport.
- **test**: Depends on transport, client, and server.
- **server**: Depends on transport and client.
- **cli**: Depends on transport and client.
- **bench**: Depends on server and client.
- **plateau**: Depends on server (which brings in the rest).

## Migration Tasks

### Phase 1: Base Libraries

- [ ] **transport-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of transport
  - Update arrow2 to arrow-rs
  - Update all imports and API usage
  - Verify tests and functionality
  
### Phase 2: Client Libraries

- [ ] **client-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of client
  - Update dependencies to use transport-arrow-rs
  - Update any direct arrow2 references
  - Verify tests and functionality

### Phase 3: Test Infrastructure

- [ ] **test-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of test
  - Update dependencies to use transport-arrow-rs and client-arrow-rs
  - Update any direct arrow2 references
  - Verify tests and functionality

### Phase 4: Server Implementation

- [ ] **server-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of server
  - Update dependencies to use transport-arrow-rs and client-arrow-rs
  - Update any direct arrow2 references (significant work expected here)
  - Update references to parquet2 if necessary
  - Verify tests and functionality

### Phase 5: CLI Tool

- [ ] **cli-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of cli
  - Update dependencies to use transport-arrow-rs and client-arrow-rs
  - Update any direct arrow2 references
  - Verify tests and functionality

### Phase 6: Benchmarking

- [ ] **bench-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of bench
  - Update dependencies to use server-arrow-rs and client-arrow-rs
  - Update any direct arrow2 references
  - Verify tests and functionality

### Phase 7: Main Application

- [ ] **plateau-arrow-rs**
  - Create copy of plateau
  - Update dependencies to use server-arrow-rs
  - Verify tests and functionality

### Phase 8: Integration

- [ ] Update workspace Cargo.toml to include new arrow-rs crates
- [ ] Update workspace patch section to remove arrow2 dependencies
- [ ] Final integration testing

## Migration Notes

### Key API Differences

- arrow-rs uses a different package structure than arrow2
- arrow-rs API may have different method names and parameters
- Data type handling might differ between arrow2 and arrow-rs
- Serialization/deserialization approaches may need adjustment
- Memory management might be different

### JSON Serialization (pandas-record format)

The repository uses the pandas-record JSON format for serialization. When migrating from arrow2 to arrow-rs, the serialization code needs to be updated to use the equivalent arrow-rs APIs. An example implementation using arrow-rs is available in `examples/serde.rs` along with sample data in `examples/records.json`.

Sample pandas-record JSON format:
```json
[
    {
        "temp": 21.0,
        "pressure": 3.0,
        "name": "sensor_1",
        "measurements": [[1.1, 2.2, 3.3], [4.4, 5.5]]
    },
    {
        "temp": 22.0,
        "pressure": 4.0,
        "name": "sensor_2", 
        "measurements": [[6.6, 7.7], [8.8, 9.9, 10.0]]
    }
]
```

Key changes for JSON serialization:

- arrow2 uses its own JSON serialization modules, while arrow-rs uses `arrow::json` and `arrow_json` modules
- Schema definition syntax differs between arrow2 and arrow-rs
- arrow-rs uses `ReaderBuilder` and `ArrayWriter` for JSON serialization/deserialization
- Field creation and nesting structure has a different syntax in arrow-rs
- Record batch handling follows a different pattern

When converting JSON serialization code, pay special attention to:

- Schema definition and field type mapping
- Nested data structures (lists, structs)
- The serialization/deserialization workflow
- Error handling differences

### Common Patterns

(This section will be updated as we progress through the migration)

- **Type conversions**: Document common type conversion patterns
- **API replacements**: Document common method replacements
- **Error handling**: Note differences in error types and handling
- **Performance considerations**: Document any performance implications

### Testing Considerations

- Ensure compatibility with existing data formats
- Verify serialization/deserialization correctness
- Check for performance regressions
- Verify memory usage patterns
- Ensure all public APIs maintain backward compatibility where possible
