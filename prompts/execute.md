You are working on migrating this repository from arrow2 to arrow-rs.

The migration plan and a record of progress is in MIGRATION.md. 

Please complete the next phase of the migration.

Also record in this document any lessons learned that might be useful for
future phases.

For the transport crate, the ser/de considerations are likely to 
be particularly important.
