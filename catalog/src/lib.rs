//! The catalog is the storage format that organizes individual segments.
//!
//! It uses the [manifest] to record metadata about all stored segments in the
//! system.
//!
//! The catalog breaks down into:
//!
//! - A [slog] to order segments.
//! - A [partition] that wraps the [slog] to enforce size constraints and handle
//!   writes to the [manifest].
//! - A [topic] that is a collection of multiple different partitions that supports
//!   read and write operations.
//! - A [catalog] that is a collection of topics.
//!
//! The catalog also by default runs a [storage] monitor to ensure that we fall back
//! to a read-only mode if the disk is too full.
