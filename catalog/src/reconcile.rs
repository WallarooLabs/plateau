//! Reconciliation job for verifying consistency between the manifest and files on disk.

//! This module provides functionality to:
//! - Verify all files on disk are tracked in the manifest
//! - Verify file sizes on disk match sizes in the manifest
//! - Detect files that don't belong to any segment in their directory
